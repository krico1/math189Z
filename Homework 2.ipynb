What you need to do is add words that are likely not in the existing stop word list that will not add any information to our topics. Because all the tweets are already about COVID-19, words used to identify the virus are likely not helpful, nor are things like 'https' and 'com' from links. Think about what words might come up a lot but do not differentiate tweets and add them to the stop list. After you run the topic modeling and see the words in the topics, continue to add unimportant words to the stop list to refine your topics (we added about 15 additional stop words but you can add as many as you think are appropriate).

    "This is an unsupervised learning technique meant to help us find structure in our data. The data will always be divided into topics, however that does not mean that the topics will have meaning. This makes the qualitative part of topic modeling very important because you need to be able to look at the topics generated above and understand whether the model seems to have captured true structure or just noise. Now we can think about ways to visualize what we have just created. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can gain intuition about our model is by checking how strongly it is classifying tweets into one category or another. In other words, how sure the model is of the topic of a tweet. When predicting the topic for a tweet, the trained model returns a distribution over the possible topics, which is referred to as that tweet in _topic space_. For example, if we had three topics it would return a vector of length 3 with the 3 values summing to 1. The topic represented by the highest probability is the principal topic of that tweet. The higher that maximum value is compared to the other probabilities, the stronger the association of that tweet to its principal topic. If tweets tend to have strong principal topics, then there is a lot of structure in the topic space of the tweets and the topics are more likely to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "By measuring this charactaristic of our model, we are making sure our model identified more general structure in the tweets and didn't train strictly on noise. While this doesn't mean that the topics have __meaning__, it is a check that there is clustering going on. To visualize whether this clustering is happening we can plot our points and color them based on their given topic. However, our data is more than 3-dimensions, making it difficult to visualize. That's where dimensionality reduction techniques come in. There are many techniques out there, but we are going to focus on PCA as it is ubiquitous, easy to understand, and very useful. \n",
